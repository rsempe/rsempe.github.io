        date: May 2025
        comment: "A perfect accommodation for cycling trips in the surrounding area. The landlords are super friendly but unobtrusive and brought us a delicious French breakfast with fruit and yogurt every morning. The pool is very well maintained and there are comfortable loungers. We had our bikes with us and after a few meters we were already on the railway cycle path and could do various tours from there. We can fully recommend this accommodation."

Simple and functional house with bathroom and reversible air conditioning in each bedroom. Well-designed outdoor space with large parking space. Emmanuelle and her husband are really nice, reactive and discreet."
